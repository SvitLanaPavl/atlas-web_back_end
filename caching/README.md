# Caching

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- What a caching system is
- What _FIFO_ means
- What _LIFO_ means
- What _LRU_ means
- What _MRU_ means
- What _LFU_ means
- What the purpose of a caching system is
- What limits a caching system has

## Requirements

### _Python Scripts_
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env python3```
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the ```pycodestyle``` style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```
- All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
- All your classes should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'```)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)```' and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
